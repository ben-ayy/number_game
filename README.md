### Simple C Guessing Game

## About

My first time using C. A simple guessing game
where you play against the computer or it plays against you.

## Usage

Compile using gcc on any POSIX system

` gcc -o game main.c games.c`

And run with

` ./game <computer|player>`

**Computer** play against computer (you guess the number)
**Player** computer plays against you (you choose the number and computer guesses)
